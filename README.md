# KDiscordIPC

A lightweight and easy to use Discord IPC wrapper for Kotlin

Many other Discord RPC / IPC libraries are either lacking in features, don't work on certain architectures or platforms,
or are no longer maintained. KDiscordIPC aims to stay up-to-date for as long as the Discord IPC API is actually
supported.
