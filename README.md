# KDiscordIPC

A lightweight and easy to use Discord IPC wrapper for Kotlin

Many other Discord RPC / IPC libraries are either lacking in features, don't work on certain architectures or platforms,
or are no longer maintained. KDiscordIPC aims to stay up-to-date for as long as the Discord IPC API is actually
supported.

KDiscordIPC is also aiming to have all the features that Discord's [GameSDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide) has, as GameSDK works exactly the same as
the "old RPC API" does.

### Features
- Works on all major platforms and architectures
  - Tested Platforms: Linux, macOS & Windows
  - Tested Architectures: aarch64, x86_64
- Easy to use Kotlin DSL
- Coroutines based

## Install

**Maven repository coming soon!**

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.cbyrne:kdiscordipc:1.0.0")
}
```

## Usage

```kotlin
val ipc = KDiscordIPC("YOUR_CLIENT_ID")

// It doesn't matter where you set `activity`.
// If your client has not connected yet, the presence will be set when it has connected. 
ipc.activityManager.activity = activity("Hello", "world") {
    // This is a simple example, you can do things like smallImage(), largeImage(), etc.
    button("Click me", "https://google.com")
    timestamps(System.currentTimeMillis(), System.currentTimeMillis() + 50000)
}

ipc.on<ReadyEvent> {
    logger.info("Ready! (${data.user.username}#${data.user.discriminator})")

    // Want to get the information of another user? Sure thing!
    val user = ipc.userManager.getUser("USER_ID")
}

ipc.connect()
```
